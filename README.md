# ClassroomAPI

This is a classroom API project which uses Azure Functions app as serverless api server. For authentication of the requests send to the function app I have used Azure AD B2C tenant which generates tokens for authentication. Azure API management is used as a middle layer between Function App and AD tenant for management of the request.
Postman software is used to create requests and retrieve the results.
